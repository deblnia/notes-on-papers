# notes on papers 

This is an [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that I use to keep track of papers I read. 

I had a precursor project to this called [Speedy Scholar](https://github.com/deblnia/speedyscholar) that, in different iterations, used R's bookdown and the dendron blogging platform to varying levels of success. 

TODO:
