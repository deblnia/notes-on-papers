- Reddit moderator strike in 2015 showed that we don't know how to think about moderators. Are these unpaid workers, or facilitator citizens, or unaccountable oligarchs? 
    - Perceptions differ by discipline (CS and law tend to think of mods as leaders, sociology as unpaid laborers)
- The meaning of moderation is defined in the everyday boundary work carried out by volunteer moderators 
- Civic labor describes the authority that is defined through negotiations with these commercial, civic, and peer stakeholders 
- Harassment is the main harm risked by mods 
- The language of governance comes up frequently whne you investigate and analyze moderator behavior
