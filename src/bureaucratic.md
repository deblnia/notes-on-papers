# A Bureaucratic Theory of Statistics

> By Ben Recht. Link [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03457). 

- Kind of a real politik for statistics: stat is selling itself short by not embracing its regulatory power
- The RCT primarily serves as a mechanism of regulation (causality is a secondary concern)
- Statistical rulemaking (eg. confidence intervals, NHST) is ex-ante policy 
    -  Ex ante because the rules and procedures are designed before data collection.
    - Ex ante policy means the specification of rules by some regulatory
body that governs acceptable future actions. 
    - They provide transparency by forcing policymakers to state their models, their means of intervention, and what they value.
    - Contrast with ex post inference (A causes B, update priors etc.) which is subjective 
- There's a kind of interesting treatment of RCTs as a function of correlation? 
$$ R(X, Y) >= \frac{t}{\sqrt{n}} $$ 
- Aleatoric randomness has been a powerful tool for fair decision-making for thousands of years.
    - We know there will always be some uncontrollable epistemic uncertainty. Adding aleatoric uncertainty to mitigate the epistemic uncertainty of confounding is a reasonable tradeoff.
