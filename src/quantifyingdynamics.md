- Three datasets: research grant applications, start-up investment records, and terrorist attacks 
- Why might failure lead to success? Learning, or chance
    - Test using the first and penultimate attempt within failure streaks 
- Found support for learning mechanism (demonstrated improvement unlikely by just chance), but neither explains distribution perfectly 
- Modelled with a single parameter representing the number of previous attempts one considers when formulating a new attempt 
- Wright's Law: the more times a task has been performed, the less time is required on each subsequent iteration ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects))
- Model shows a phase transition that separates the dynamics of failure into stagnation of progress 
- Some empirically testable predictions: 
    - Not all failures lead to success
    - Early dynamical signals separate the success group from the non-success group 
    - Patterns of performance improvement diverge 
    - The length of failure streaks follows a Weibull distribution
